# Phone-Number-Validator
Please enter your credentials in verifiy.php file to make the program work. (I have deleted mine) <br />
When you start the server, index.html will ask you to enter your phone number (should be recorded in twilio) and then you will get a confirmation message. Enter the number and verify your number.<br />
I added twilio-php-main SDK just in case. You will have to unzip it.
